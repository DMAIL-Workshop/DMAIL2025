- Step 2: Select your role as "author". From the top menu, click the "New Submission" button, and then select "DMAIL 2025: The First International Workshop on Data Mining and AI for Law" to continue.
- Step 3: Enter your paper information and then use the "Submit" button at the bottom of the form.

**Paper Length, Formatting, and Reviewing:**
- <div style="text-align: justify"> The length of each paper submitted should be no more than 10 pages, and formatted following the standard 2-column U.S. letter style of IEEE Conference template. See the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Proceedings Author Guidelines</a> for further information and instructions.</div>
- <div style="text-align: justify"> All submissions will be double-blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to the scope of the special session, originality, significance, and clarity. The names and affiliations of authors must not appear in the submissions, and bibliographic references must be adjusted to preserve author anonymity. Submissions failing to comply with paper formatting and authors anonymity will be rejected without reviews.</div>
- <div style="text-align: justify"> Authors are also encouraged to submit supplementary materials, i.e., providing the source code and data through a GitHub-like public repository to support the reproducibility of their research results.</div>
<!-- **Submission portal:** [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DSAA2022](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DSAA2022) -->

<!-- <div style="text-align: justify"> Special session papers strictly follow the same specifications, requirements, and policies as the main conference submissions in terms of paper formatting and length and important policies. Reviewing the submissions in each special session is coordinated by the special session organizers and is fully aligned to the main conference evaluation process.

# **Important Policies**

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Reproducibility:</B> The advancement of science depends heavily on reproducibility. We strongly recommend that the authors release their code and data to the public. Authors can provide an optional two-page supplement at the end of their submitted paper (it needs to be in the same PDF file and start at page 11). This supplement can only be used to include:</div>

- <div style="text-align: justify"> Information necessary for reproducing the experimental results reported in the paper (e.g., various algorithmic and model parameters and configurations, hyper parameter search spaces, details related to data set filtering and train/test splits, software versions, detailed hardware configuration, etc.).</div>
- <div style="text-align: justify"> Any data, pseudo-code and proofs that could not be included in the main page of the manuscript due to space limitations.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Authorship:</B> The list of authors at the time of submission is considered final and any further changes of the authorship are not allowed.</div>
</br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Dual Submissions:</B> ICDM is an archival publication venue as such submissions that have been previously published, accepted, or are currently under consideration at other peer-review publication venues (i.e., journals, conferences, workshops with published proceedings, etc) are not permitted.</div>
</br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Conflicts of Interest (COI):</B> COIs must be declared at the time of submission. COIs include employment at the same institution within the past three years, collaborations during the past three years, advisor/advisee relationships, plus family and close friends.</div>
</br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Attendance:</B> At least one of the authors of each accepted paper must register in full and attend the conference to present the paper. No-show papers will be removed from the IEEE Xplore proceedings.
