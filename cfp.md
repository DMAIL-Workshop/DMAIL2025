# **Workshop Aims and Scope**

<div style="text-align: justify"> The DMAIL 2025 workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to explore cutting-edge developments in AI/data-driven legal analytics, judicial decision modeling, argument mining, and among others. This workshop seeks to address key challenges in applying DM/AI techniques to legal data, including legal text processing (e.g., information extraction, reasoning, retrieval, summarization, prediction), bias detection, ethical AI deployment in law, and others. It will provide a platform for discussions on innovative methodologies, emerging datasets, case studies, and real-world applications that can improve legal reasoning, transparency, and fairness in legal systems worldwide. </div> 

# **Topics of Interest**

<div style="text-align: justify"> DMAIL 2025 workshop invites authors to submit original manuscripts that demonstrate and explore current advances in all related areas mentioned above. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: </div>

<br/>

- Large-scale and high-quality datasets for legal DM and Intelligence
- Predictive modeling of court decisions
- AI-assisted legal reasoning and judgment prediction
- Legal document classification and question answering
- Case law retrieval and citation analysis
- Argument mining and reasoning in legal discourse
- Knowledge graph for legal DM

# **Submission Guideline and Reviewing**
**Submission Instructions:** 
- Step 1: Login and enter DMAIL 2025 workshop in EasyChair. Website: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=dmail2025">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=dmail2025</a>
- Step 2: Select your role as "author". From the top menu, click the "New Submission" button, and then select "DMAIL 2025: The First International Workshop on Data Mining and AI for Law" to continue.
- Step 3: Enter your paper information and then use the "Submit" button at the bottom of the form.

**Paper Length, Formatting, and Reviewing:**
- <div style="text-align: justify"> The length of each paper submitted should be no more than 10 pages, and formatted following the standard 2-column U.S. letter style of IEEE Conference template. See the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Proceedings Author Guidelines</a> for further information and instructions.</div>
- <div style="text-align: justify"> All submissions will be double-blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to the scope of the special session, originality, significance, and clarity. The names and affiliations of authors must not appear in the submissions, and bibliographic references must be adjusted to preserve author anonymity. Submissions failing to comply with paper formatting and authors anonymity will be rejected without reviews.</div>
- <div style="text-align: justify"> Authors are also encouraged to submit supplementary materials, i.e., providing the source code and data through a GitHub-like public repository to support the reproducibility of their research results.</div>

**Proceedings:**
- <div style="text-align: justify"> All submissions will be triple-blind reviewed by the Program Committee based on technical quality, relevance to the scope of the workshop, originality, significance, and clarity. Manuscripts must be submitted electronically through EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=dmail2025">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=dmail2025</a>.</div>

<!-- 
- Submissions must be original work and should not be under submission to other venues at the time of review.

- The length of each paper submitted to the workshop should be no more than 10 pages, and the papers should be formatted following the standard 2-column U.S. letter style of IEEE Conference template. See the IEEE Proceedings Author Guidelines: [http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html), for further information and instructions.

- Authors are also encouraged to submit supplementary materials, i.e., providing the source code and data through a GitHub-like public repository to support the reproducibility of their research results.
    
- Papers will then be assigned to appropriate PCMs by the workshop organizers for review.
    
- Workshop organizers will make recommendations of acceptance/rejection for papers in their sessions, which must be validated by General chairs, Research, and Application track chairs.

- To guarantee uniform quality control for this workshop, the final decisions of workshop paper acceptance/rejection are made by the DMAIL Program Chairs. -->

# **Important Policies**

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Reproducibility:</B> The advancement of science depends heavily on reproducibility. We strongly recommend that the authors release their code and data to the public. Authors can provide an optional two-page supplement at the end of their submitted paper (it needs to be in the same PDF file and start at page 11). This supplement can only be used to include:</div>

- <div style="text-align: justify"> Information necessary for reproducing the experimental results reported in the paper (e.g., various algorithmic and model parameters and configurations, hyper parameter search spaces, details related to data set filtering and train/test splits, software versions, detailed hardware configuration, etc.).</div>
- <div style="text-align: justify"> Any data, pseudo-code and proofs that could not be included in the main page of the manuscript due to space limitations.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Authorship:</B> The list of authors at the time of submission is considered final and any further changes of the authorship are not allowed.</div>
</br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Dual Submissions:</B> ICDM is an archival publication venue as such submissions that have been previously published, accepted, or are currently under consideration at other peer-review publication venues (i.e., journals, conferences, workshops with published proceedings, etc) are not permitted.</div>
</br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Conflicts of Interest (COI):</B> COIs must be declared at the time of submission. COIs include employment at the same institution within the past three years, collaborations during the past three years, advisor/advisee relationships, plus family and close friends.</div>
</br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> <B>Attendance:</B> At least one of the authors of each accepted paper must register in full and attend the conference to present the paper. No-show papers will be removed from the IEEE Xplore proceedings.
