Welcome to the DMAIL 2025: The First International Workshop on Data Mining and AI for Law. The 25th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) ([ICDM2025](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~icdm2025/index.html)).

<br/>


<div style="text-align: justify"> With the rapid advancements in data mining (DM) and artificial intelligence (AI), legal informatics has emerged as a critical interdisciplinary domain where computational methods can significantly enhance legal research, decision-making, and access to justice. The DMAIL 2025 workshop aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to explore cutting-edge developments in AI/data-driven legal analytics, judicial decision modeling, argument mining, and among others. This workshop seeks to address key challenges in applying DM/AI techniques to legal data, including legal text processing (e.g., information extraction, reasoning, retrieval, summarization, prediction), bias detection, ethical AI deployment in law, and others. It will provide a platform for discussions on innovative methodologies, emerging datasets, case studies, and real-world applications that can improve legal reasoning, transparency, and fairness in legal systems worldwide.</a>. </div>
